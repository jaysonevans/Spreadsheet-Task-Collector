# Spreadsheet-Task-Collector
Spreadsheet-Task-Collector is a VBA macro that can be added to an Excel spreadsheet and used to pull soon-to-be due tasks into a new spreadsheet in the workbook. Along with text content, this macro has the functionality to add the background color formatting of the original tasks.
As of version 1.0.0, the macro is not quite as modular as to be desired, so in-code changes are suggested to those with different workflows.

## Installation
Download, unzip, and import into an Excel workbook.

For those using Excel on MacOS, you will have to add the dictionary data structure or substitute it for a function with match statements. I recommend [VBA-Dictionary](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary).
